# AWS processing scripts for probe characterization from EPICv1 to EPICv2
This repo contains a series of scripts with specialized functions used to characterize probe similarities of those lost on when transitioning from Illumina's EPICv1 array to its new EPICv2 array. A number of different different metrics were used to ascertain propbe similaritry, and each function rank-orders suitable candidates based on those metrics.
